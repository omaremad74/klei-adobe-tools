# Notes to know before reading on the formats

## FACINGS FORMAT
+ FACING_RIGHT      = 1 << 0
+ FACING_UP         = 1 << 1
+ FACING_LEFT       = 1 << 2
+ FACING_DOWN       = 1 << 3
+ FACING_UPRIGHT    = 1 << 4
+ FACING_UPLEFT     = 1 << 5
+ FACING_DOWNRIGHT  = 1 << 6
+ FACING_DOWNLEFT   = 1 << 7

## Hashing

Klei hashes their strings through this logic (For Don't Starve and Rotwood at least, Invisible Inc seems to have different hashing logic it seems?):

```
def strhash(str):
    hash = 0
    for c in str:
        v = ord(c.lower())
        hash = (v + (hash << 6) + (hash << 16) - hash) & 0xFFFFFFFFL
    return hash
```

## Vertex

+ 'x' x-coordinate of the vertex
+ 'y' y-coordinate of the vertex
+ 'z' z-coordinate of the vertex. (In the case of 2D animated games like DS/T or Rotwood this is always going to be 0!)
+ 'u' horizontal axis of texture
+ 'v' vertical axis of texture
+ 'w' texture/material sampler

## Naming schemes

'Root Symbols' and banks refer to one another.  
'Materials' and atlases refer to one another.  
'Folders' and layers refer to one another.

### PLAX
NOTES: 'What is plax?' It's Klei's implementation of parallax backgrounds! Despite being `.tex` they don't really have any texture data on their own 
they contain data referencing other actual `KTEX` textures to perform logic on with different configurations in usage for scene backgrounds as far as I understand.
I'm heavily referencing this lovely repositories work, I do not fully understand the format myself yet: https://github.com/instant-noodles/gltools/blob/master/src/gltex.py
I've yet to understand what a 'pbox' is!
+ "PLAX"
+ Num Root (byte)
+ Width (int32_t)
+ Height (int32_t)
+ Root Name (length in byte, string)
+ Num Splices (int32_t)
+ For each splice:

## Invisible Inc.

NOTES: Invisible Inc uses .KWAD files ("Klei, Where's All the Data?") that contain compressed animations, builds, and textures all together
It is unlikely I will get to supporting KWAD in a timely manner. Sorry! But the documentation for its format is here :3
For more information, check out this git!: https://github.com/Psimage/KWADTool/

Invisible Inc has two versions for its KWAD format, indicated by signatures at the first eight bytes, "KLEIPKG1" and "KLEIPKG2"

'Instances' refer to elements, this is how Invisible Inc documentation refers to it.

I'm unsure what 'Parent' refers to.

CM index and CA index seems to refer to specific color logic. I am lost here:
https://github.com/Psimage/KWADTool/pull/1/commits/9550bb7b843360ad876bf04a59e56ea7da05767f

For encoded_strings, see: `char[len + (4 - len % 4) % 4]  : string contents padded to maintain DWORD alignment`
